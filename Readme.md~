#CoMW

Comparative Metatranscriptomics Workflow is a standardized and validated workflow to functionally classify quality filtered mRNA reads from metatranscriptomic or total RNA studiesgenerated using HiSeq, MiSeq. CoMW is used for classification of these reads using assembled contigs to the reference databases provided and cited. 

If you use CoMW in your research, please cite:
